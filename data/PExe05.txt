  The unit sphere of directions is partitioned into quads that have the standard 10-degree theta and 15-degree phi spacing

  The radiance distribution is computed on the following (theta, phi ,geometric depth, wavelength) grid:

  ***** BEGIN IOP MODEL SPECIFICATIONS *****

     The "New Case 2" IOP routine is being used:

          The absorption and scattering coefficients are determined by five components:

           Component 1 is pure water
           Component 2 is chlorophyll-bearing particles (includes absorption and small-particle phytoplankton scattering)
           Component 3 is total CDOM (assumed to be nonscattering)
           Component 4 is mineral particles (that do not covary with chlorophyll)
           Component 5 is large-particle phytoplankton scattering (absorption included in Component 2)
           The IOP printout also shows:
           Component 6 is the part of total CDOM that covaries with Chlorophyll
           Component 7 is the part of total CDOM that does not covary with Chlorophyll
                       (See the Technical Documentation or the source code for the bio-optical models that
                        convert these components concentrations to absorption and scattering coefficients.)

  Component 1 (pure water) specification:

     Pure water a and b values are computed as functions of temperature T and salinity S for
        T = 20.0 deg C and S = 35.0 PSU

     The phase function for IOP component  1 comes from file
        ../data/phase_functions/HydroLight/dpf_pure_H2O.txt

     The first  1 header records from data file ../data/phase_functions/HydroLight/dpf_pure_H2O.txt are:

  Component 2 (chlorophyll-bearing particles) specification:

     The Chlorophyll concentration Chl(z) is obtained from measured values read from file:

        (Linear interpolation is used to define Chl(z) at all depths)

     The first  1 header records from data file C:/HE60/run/exe04/Chlzdata_exe04.txt are:
        EXAMPLE "chlzdata" file showing the Hydrolight "Chlorophyll-data standard format" for use in IOP models.

          6 header records read

          2 data records read

     The scattering spectrum b(z,wavelength) for component 2 is calculated using a Power Law model:
          b = 0.3000 [concentration(z)]^(0.6200) * (550.0/wavelength)^(1.0000)

     The phase function for IOP component  2 comes from file

  Component 3 (total CDOM) specification:


     The CDOM absorption coefficient a_CDOM(z,lambda0) at a reference wavelength lambda0 
        is obtained from measured values read from the file:
        C:/HE60/run/exe04/Cdomz_exe04.txt

        EXAMPLE "chlzdata" file showing the Hydrolight "Chlorophyll-data standard format" for use in IOP models.
        These files are read by Hydrolight subroutine Chlz_data on file ..\Source_code\common_code\Chlz_data_mod.f95
        Any number of header records (for identification of the user's data) can be used; set these records off by \begin_header and \end_header records.
        The first data record begins with (free format) pairs of depth (in m) and Chl (in mg Chl / m^3) values.
        The last value is flagged by either an end of file or by negative depth and Chl values

          2 data records read

     The CDOM absorption spectrum for component 3 is calculated from an exponential model:
          a*(lambda) = 0.0000* exp[-0.0140*(lambda - 440.0)]

     CDOM is assumed to be non-scattering

   [(Theta,Phi) are the directions of radiance propagation.
   For sky radiances only, theta is measured from 0 at the zenith.
   IF the sun is at phi = 0, solar radiance propagates in the Phi = 180 direction, and then
   Phi = 45 represents the 135 degree viewing angle for minimizing sun glitter.]

   [(Theta,Phi) are the directions of radiance propagation.
   For sky radiances only, theta is measured from 0 at the zenith.
   IF the sun is at phi = 0, solar radiance propagates in the Phi = 180 direction, and then
   Phi = 45 represents the 135 degree viewing angle for minimizing sun glitter.]

   [(Theta,Phi) are the directions of radiance propagation.
   For sky radiances only, theta is measured from 0 at the zenith.
   IF the sun is at phi = 0, solar radiance propagates in the Phi = 180 direction, and then
   Phi = 45 represents the 135 degree viewing angle for minimizing sun glitter.]

   [(Theta,Phi) are the directions of radiance propagation.
   For sky radiances only, theta is measured from 0 at the zenith.
   IF the sun is at phi = 0, solar radiance propagates in the Phi = 180 direction, and then
   Phi = 45 represents the 135 degree viewing angle for minimizing sun glitter.]

   [(Theta,Phi) are the directions of radiance propagation.
   For sky radiances only, theta is measured from 0 at the zenith.
   IF the sun is at phi = 0, solar radiance propagates in the Phi = 180 direction, and then
   Phi = 45 represents the 135 degree viewing angle for minimizing sun glitter.]

  Spectral Radiances Just Above the Water Surface (at z = a) [units of W/(m^2 sr nm)] at  677.5 nm
  and f/Q = Lu/[Ed (bb/a)] [units of 1/sr] just below the surface (at z = 0)

   [(Theta,Phi) are the directions of radiance propagation.
   For sky radiances only, theta is measured from 0 at the zenith.
   IF the sun is at phi = 0, solar radiance propagates in the Phi = 180 direction, and then
   Phi = 45 represents the 135 degree viewing angle for minimizing sun glitter.]

   [(Theta,Phi) are the directions of radiance propagation.
   For sky radiances only, theta is measured from 0 at the zenith.
   IF the sun is at phi = 0, solar radiance propagates in the Phi = 180 direction, and then
   Phi = 45 represents the 135 degree viewing angle for minimizing sun glitter.]

  Secchi depth calculations using Preisendorfer (1986):

     Gamma = 8.00
     The final depth-averaged alpha and K obtained after 101 iterations are
     alpha =-NaN     1/m
         K =  0.0945 1/m

     The final estimate for the Secchi depth is z_SD =    9.50 m
 

  NOTE: The current estimate for the Secchi depth z_SD is greater than the maximum output depth for the run (  10.00 m)
       Therefore, z_SD cannot be computed.  To compute zSD, rerun HydroLight or EcoLight to a deeper depth
